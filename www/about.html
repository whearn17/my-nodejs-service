                    <p>There was a reason for her shyness. Everyone assumed it had always been there but she knew better.
                        She knew the exact moment that the shyness began. It had been that fateful moment at the lake. 
                        There are just some events that do that to you.
                    </p>
                    <p>She had been told time and time again that the most important steps were the first and the last.
                         It was something that she carried within her in everything she did, but then he showed up and disrupted everything.
                          He told her that she had it wrong. The first step wasn't the most important. The last step wasn't the most important. 
                          It was the next step that was the most important.

                    <p>She's asked the question so many times that she barely listened to the answers anymore. 
                        The answers were always the same. Well, not exactly the same, but the same in a general sense. 
                        A more accurate description was the answers never surprised her. So, she asked for the 10,000th time, "What's your favorite animal?" 
                        But this time was different. When she heard the young boy's answer, she wondered if she had heard him correctly.
